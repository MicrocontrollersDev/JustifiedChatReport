# JustifiedChatReport

### This is not associated with Polyfrost or Justified (not really sure what Justified is either) and is my own work.

A commissioned (for $0, I'm not scamming someone for a mod I made in a day) mod for iyda /
Justified (hence the name).

## Features

The main thing JCR does is report chat messages automatically if they contain certain phrases.

- Add phrases by using the command `/jcr add <type> <mode> <text>`
    - Types: `whole`, `words`
    - Modes: `starts`, `ends`, `contains`, `equals`
- Remove phrases by using the command `/jcr remove <type> <mode> <text>`
- List phrases by using the command `/jcr print`
- Clear phrases by using the command `/jcr clear`
- Config other settings via OneConfig
    - Whether the mod should be enabled
    - How long to wait before reporting a message
    - Keybind to confirm a report
    - Keybind to deny a report
- Sends a notification when a message is detected, reported, or denied

that they made in a day (although I understand if you really need the money).
